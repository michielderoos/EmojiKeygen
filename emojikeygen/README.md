# Emojikeygen API  

This is the API portion of the emojikeygen project. 

## Instructions to run locally  
  
- Install requirements (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`) from the root directory
- Run `python app.py` from the root directory
- That's it! The backend should now be live on port 5000  

## Endpoints  
There's only one endpoint for this API, which you can GET or POST to depending on whether you're generating a key, or retrieving one.
### Generation:  
Endpoint: `/emojikey`   
Method: POST  
Body: JSON (Example below)
```
{
	"name": "Francine",
	"strategy": "shortseq"
} 
```  
- `name` - Mandatory field, name of person requesting key  
- `strategy` - How we shorten the key. This is optional.  
 Options are `shortseq`, `dracula` and `emojihash` (default)
   
This endpoint will give a response resembling this:  
```
{
    "emojikey": "üê´üêà"
}
```

### Decoding:  
Endpoint: /emojikey/{seq}  (E.g. /emojikey/üê´üêà)  
Method: GET  
This endpoint will give a response resembling this:  
```
{
    "name": "Francine"
}
```
## Details  
The API is broken up into a few different components as detailed below
### Config: 
config.py is a basic config file which comes equipped out of the box with settings that allow you to run the API locally with no modification. Their functions are as follows:  
```
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI - URI for database where we're storing names and keys. By default (for demo purposes) this is set to a new local sqlite database, in prod you'll want to change this to whatever DBMS you choose  

PEPPER - This is the pepper we add to strings before using a hashing function to build a key. **This should be changed before use**  

DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY - We encrypt private keys before storing them, and this is the key we use. **This should be changed before use**  

DEFAULT_RANDOM_SEQUENCE_LENGTH - This is how many emojis we generate for the emojihash strategy  
  
MARKOV_CORPUS_URL - This is where the corpus for the markov strategy can be downloaded. (Default: Dracula from Project Gutenberg)
```
 
### Shorteners: 
Emojikeygen supports multiple strategies to create sequence/key pairs  
See [shorteners/README.md](shorteners/README.md) for more detail on these.
